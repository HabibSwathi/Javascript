    <h1>7) Delete Method</h1>
    <p>Array element can be delete by using delete method in the javascript.</p>
    <p>If we use the method to delete the array element just it deletes that value but not the place like index value it
        will leaves undefined holes in that array.</p>

    <p>Syntax</p>
    <pre>
        delete array [Index]
    </pre>

    <script>
        let bikes = ['yamaha', 'ducatti', 'Royal Enfield', 'TVs', 'Honda'];
        console.log('Before using delete (value)', bikes);
        console.log('Before using delete (length)', bikes);

        //deleting a element using delete method
        delete bikes[3];
        console.log('After using delete (value)', bikes);
        console.log('After using delete (length)', bikes);

        //deleting a element using delete method
        delete bikes[0];
        console.log('After using delete (value)', bikes);
        console.log('After using delete (length)', bikes);

        console.log('Index 0 = ', bikes[0]);
        console.log('Index 1 = ', bikes[1]);
        console.log('Index 2 = ', bikes[2]);
        console.log('Index 3 = ', bikes[3]);
        console.log('Index 4 = ', bikes[4]);
